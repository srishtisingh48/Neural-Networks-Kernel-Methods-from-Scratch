# Image Classification on CIFAR-10
  🛫 🚘 🐦 🐱 🦌 🐶 🐸 🐴 🚢 🛻

## Information before starting

In this problem, we will explore different deep learning architectures for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Make sure that you are familiar with torch `Tensor`s, two-dimensional convolutions (`nn.Conv2d`) and fully-connected layers (`nn.Linear`), ReLU non-linearities (`F.relu`), pooling (`nn.MaxPool2d`), and tensor reshaping (`view`). **Make sure to read through all instructions in both this notebook and in the PDF while completing this problem!**

### Problem Introduction

You've already had some practice using the PyTorch library in HW3, but this problem dives into training more complex deep learning models.

The specific task we are trying to solve in this problem is image classification. We're using a common dataset called CIFAR-10 which has 60,000 images separated into 10 classes:
* airplane
* automobile
* bird
* cat
* deer
* dog
* frog
* horse
* ship
* truck

We've provided an end-to-end example of loading data, training a model, and performing evaluation. We recommend using this code as a template for your implementations of the more complex models. Feel free to modify or reuse any of the functions we provide.

**Unlike other coding problems in the past, this one does not include an autograded component.**

### Enabling GPU

We are using Google Colab because it has free GPU runtimes available. GPUs can accelerate training times for this problem by 10-100x when compared to using CPU. To use the GPU runtime on Colab, make sure to **enable** the runtime by going to **Runtime -> Change runtime type -> Select T4 GPU under "Hardware accelerator"**.

Note that GPU runtimes are *limited* on Colab. We recommend limiting your training to short-running jobs (under 15 minutes each) and spread your work over time, if possible. Colab *will* limit your usage of GPU time, so plan ahead and be prepared to take breaks during training. If you have used up your quota for GPU, check back in a day or so to be able to enable GPU again.

Your code will still run on CPU, so if you are just starting to implement your code or have been GPU limited by Colab, you can still make changes and run your code - it will just be quite a bit slower. You can also choose to download your notebook and run locally if you have a personal GPU or have a faster CPU than the one Colab provides. If you choose to do this, you may need to install the packages that this notebook depends on to your `cse446` conda environment or to another Python environment of your choice.

To check if you have enabled GPU, run the following cell. If `device` is `cuda`, it means that GPU has been enabled successfully.

"""### Submitting your assignment

Once you are done with the problem, make sure to put all of your necessary figures into your PDF submission. Then, download this notebook as a Python file (`.py`) by going to **File -> Download -> Download `.py`**. Rename this file as `hw4-a3.py` and upload to the Gradescope submission for HW4 code.

## End-to-end Example

### Background and Setup

1. We first import all of the dependencies required for this problem:
"""

# Commented out IPython magic to ensure Python compatibility.
import torch
from torch import nn
import numpy as np

from typing import Tuple, Union, List, Callable
from torch.optim import SGD
import torchvision
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset, random_split
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from tqdm.notebook import tqdm

# %matplotlib inline

"""2. And check if we are using GPU, if it is available. (Make sure to set your runtime to enable GPU!)"""

DEVICE = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
print(DEVICE)  # this should print out CUDA

"""*To use the GPU, you will need to send both the model and the data to a device; this transfers the model from its default location on CPU to the GPU.*

*Note that torch operations on Tensors will fail if they are not located on the same device. Here's a small example of how to send the model and data to your device:*

  ```python
  model = model.to(DEVICE)  # Sending a model to GPU

  for x, y in tqdm(data_loader):
    x, y = x.to(DEVICE), y.to(DEVICE)
  ```
*When reading tensors you may need to send them back to cpu, you can do so with `x = x.cpu()`*

3. Now, let's load the CIFAR-10 data. We can take advantage of public datasets available through PyTorch torchvision!
"""

train_dataset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10("./data", train=True, download=True, transform=torchvision.transforms.ToTensor())
test_dataset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10("./data", train=False, download=True, transform=torchvision.transforms.ToTensor())

"""4. Finally, like we did in HW3, we'll use the PyTorch `DataLoader` to wrap our datasets. You've already seen that `DataLoader`s handle batching, shuffling, and iterating over data, and this is really useful for this problem as well!

*Since training on all of the 50,000 training samples can be prohibitively expensive, we define a flag called* `SAMPLE_DATA` *that controls if we should make the dataset smaller for faster training time. When* `SAMPLE_DATA=true`, *we'll only use 10% of our training data when training and performing our hyperparameter searches.*  **Make sure that you've set `SAMPLE_DATA=false` when you want to perform your final training loops for submission!**
"""

SAMPLE_DATA = False # set this to True if you want to speed up training when searching for hyperparameters!

batch_size = 128

if SAMPLE_DATA:
  train_dataset, _ = random_split(train_dataset, [int(0.1 * len(train_dataset)), int(0.9 * len(train_dataset))]) # get 10% of train dataset and "throw away" the other 90%

train_dataset, val_dataset = random_split(train_dataset, [int(0.9 * len(train_dataset)), int( 0.1 * len(train_dataset))])

# Create separate dataloaders for the train, test, and validation set
train_loader = DataLoader(
    train_dataset,
    batch_size=batch_size,

)

"""Now, we're ready to train!

### Logistic Regression Example

Let's first take a look at our data to get an understanding of what we are doing. As a reminder, CIFAR-10 is a dataset containing images split into 10 classes.

# This is one way to flatten our images
batch_flat_view = imgs.view(-1, c * w * h)

# This is another equivalent way
batch_flat_flatten = imgs.flatten(1)

d = example_image.flatten().size()[0]
print(c * w * h == d)

# View the image
t =  torchvision.transforms.ToPILImage()

# visit https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html
